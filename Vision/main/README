In an attempt to streamline the addition of code, I have split up the original code base into many files. All functions should be defined in their respective file and ONLY called in "main.py" or from a function called in "main.py". If there isn't an obvious ".py" file for what you are trying to code, add it.

This is done to hopefully reduce the spaghettiness of our code, making it easier to debug in the future. "main.py" will be where all of the functions are called at competition.
