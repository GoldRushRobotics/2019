The dirs that look like {ball,cube,tels}Cas{5...32} correspond to trained cascades for an object with 5 to 32 iterations. Use identify.py to use these cascades to find objects in an image.

The training dir contains a whole bunch of scripts to take raw videos/images and create vectors to train a cascade on an HPC server. The file structure has changed a bit, so some tweaking might be needed to run.

Training can be done following a few steps:
Collect/download negative images (A ton of images without your object)
Collect images with your object form multiple angles (only a few 50-100)
Use vid2img.py to convert pos/neg images into greyscale
Use create_pos_n_neg() function in getNegs.py to index your negative images int bg.txt
Run mkVec.sh to create more positive samples from your negative background images
Upload vecs and negatives to HPC and run qsub.sh
