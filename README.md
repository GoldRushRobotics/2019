Competition for 2019

Motion is for Pi communicating to Arduino which drives the mechanical bits of the robot
  Code should only go here if it involves moving some part of the robot or deals with communication between the Pi and Arduino to move the  bot.

Vision is for the Python people who are making the robot see. Unless your code helps the robot see, it doesn't belong.

Control is for everything doesn't involve robot movement or computer vision. Such as, color sensor, touch screen, raising the flag, diagnostics, etc.
